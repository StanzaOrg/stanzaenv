# How does calling an extension work? #

As input, we need the extension name, e.g. "jstanza". 

Given, this extension name, look in `project-config` and `global-config` for how this extension is registered.

  Helper: Get extension location.

Case: We find the extension location.

Then this is the executable to call.

Case: We do not find the extension location.

In this case, report that there is no extended Stanza within the current project with this name.
